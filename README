Ruby2CExtension
===============

Ruby2CExtension is a Ruby to C extension translator/compiler. It takes any Ruby
source file, parses it using Ruby's builtin parser and then translates the
abstract syntax tree into "equivalent" C extension code.


Requirements
------------

Ruby2CExtension is developed for and only tested with Ruby 1.8.4. So you should
really use that version. It might work with other 1.8 versions, it definitely
won't work with Ruby 1.9.

Ruby2CExtension requires RubyNode to access Ruby's node trees (the AST).
RubyNode is available at http://rubynode.rubyforge.org/.

Ruby2CExtension is pure Ruby code, so it should work on all plattforms that
Ruby supports, but it is currently only tested on Linux. There might be
problems with the C code to shared object compiling step on some platforms.


Installation
------------

Just run (as root):

  ruby setup.rb

This will install rb2cx and ruby2cext.rb to the default locations. Optionally
you can supply some options to setup.rb, to customize the installation (see
"ruby setup.rb --help").


Usage / Features / Limitations
------------------------------

To translate a Ruby file foo.rb to a C extension, just run:

  rb2cx foo.rb

For more information please see doc/index.html and doc/limitations.html.


Feedback
--------

If you find a bug, think that something doesn't work as it should or have other
suggestions, then please don't hesitate to contact me (dbatml@gmx.de) and tell
me about it.

I am also interested to know if Ruby2CExtension works under Windows (or other
non Linux platforms).
