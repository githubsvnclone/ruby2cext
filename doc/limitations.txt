h1. Ruby2CExtension Limitations

Ruby2CExtension has some limitations. Some things do not work "by design"
other things don't work because they are not (yet) implemented.

Generally Ruby2CExtension tries to match Ruby's semantics as close as
possible, so if a Ruby file doesn't fail to compile and doesn't have any of
the issues described below, then the compiled C extension should just work and
behave exactly as the Ruby code would.


h2. Warnings and Exceptions

Not all warnings, that Ruby code might emit, are reproduced in the compiled C
extension.

Ruby2CExtension also omits some checks that might raise exceptions for Ruby
code (it won't warn or raise exceptions on wrong argument count in lambdas for
example).

As a rule of thumb: if Ruby code works without warnings then the compiled C
extension will also work without warnings, but if the Ruby code emits
warnings, then the compiled C extension might emit less warnings.

Also, sometimes the compiled C extension will raise slightly different
exceptions than the Ruby code would.


h2. C Extension Limitations

Because the compiled code will be a C extension it will also behave like a C
extension:

* backtraces will look like backtraces of C extensions (i.e. no line
  numbers, ...)
* a trace proc set with @set_trace_func@ will only get C extension events
  (@"c-call"@, @"c-return"@, @"raise"@), instead of the usual Ruby code events


h2. Arity

All methods and procs defined in Ruby code that is compiled to a C extension
will return @-1@ as @arity@. So if your Ruby code depends on the method
@arity@, you might have to change your code.


h2. Continuations

Continuations (@callcc@) are possible in compiled Ruby code, but you might see
wrong behaviour with local variables (i.e. they will have an old value),
depending on whether these local variables are needed for a closure or not.

In short, you probably should not use continuations in Ruby code that you want
to compile to a C extension.


h2. Scope

In Ruby every scope (class scope, methods, ...) has an associated C struct
SCOPE which stores the local variables (including @$~@ and @$_@) for that scope.
Methods that are implemented in a C extension don't get such a SCOPE, because
it is expensive to set up and they don't need it (they just use variables on
the stack).

That means that the methods in Ruby code that is compiled to a C extension
won't get a SCOPE either, which is usually no problem because local variables
are handled differently anyway. It only gets a problem, if the code uses
methods that work with the current SCOPE. Here are some of these methods:

* @local_variables@
* @eval@
* @binding@

These methods will work, but they will see the SCOPE of the nearest Ruby code
scope. This is also true for @$_@ and @$~@ (and the derived @$&@, @$`@, @$'@,
@$1@, ...). Example:

PRE
def bar
  a = 2
  "xxx" =~ /./ # changes $~ of the nearest Ruby code scope
  p eval("a") # won't return 2 (a's value), instead it will be evaled in the
              # nearest Ruby code scope
  local_variables # returns local variables of the nearest Ruby code scope
end
PREEND

If bar is compiled into a C extension and then called from the following Ruby
code:

PRE
a = b = 42
$~ = nil
p bar
p $~
PREEND

Then it will output

PRE
42
["a", "b"]
#<MatchData: ...>
PREEND

instead of the expected

PRE
2
["a"]
nil
PREEND

Another consequence is that if compiled methods call each other, they will all
share the same @$_@ and @$~@ (those of the nearest Ruby code scope). This
might make some code behave unexpectedly.


h2. Vmode

The so called vmode is also associated with the Ruby SCOPE (though not
directly stored inside the SCOPE struct). The vmode is set by methods like
@private@, @protected@ and @public@ and determines which visibility newly
defined methods get.

Ruby2CExtension does not access the current vmode, instead it tries to figure
out at compile time what visibility a method defined using @def@ will get.
@Module#define_method@ will use vmode.

If your code doesn't do anything tricky, then the compile time heuristic
should just work as expected. Here is an example, where it fails:

PRE
class A
  def pub; end # public

  private if nil # Ruby2CExtension sees a call to private, so all following defs
                 # will be private
  def pub2; end # will be private in the compiled C extension
  define_method(:pub3) {} # will be public
end
PREEND

As above calling methods like @private@ in a compiled C extension can affect
the calling Ruby code:

PRE
# in compiled C extension
def my_private
  private
end
PREEND

PRE
# in Ruby code
class A
  def a;end # public
  my_private
  def b;end # private, but would be public if the above code was not compiled
end
PREEND

To be save, don't use the methods @private@, @public@, ... without arguments,
if they are used with arguments (like @private :meth1, :meth2@), they will not
change the current vmode.

You are also save if you only use them in class scopes (which should usually
be the case), because the class scopes are run directly when requiring the
compiled C extension and Ruby will reset the vmode to the previous value
afterwards.

Here is an example which works as expected and is safe:

PRE
# start of foo.rb
def m1; end # private
class A
  def m2; end # public
  private
  def m3; end # private
  define_method(:m4) {} # private
  protected
  def m5; end # protected
end
def m6; end # private
public
def m7; end # public
# end of foo.rb
PREEND


h2. Cref

The so called cref is another Ruby internal that Ruby2CExtension has to
emulate. The cref is a linked list that describes the current lexical
class/module nesting. Example:

PRE
class A
  class B
    # cref here is B -> A -> Object
  end
  # cref here is A -> Object
  module C
    # cref here is C -> A -> Object
  end
end
# cref here is Object
PREEND

The current cref is used for constant and class variable lookup and for @def@,
@undef@ and @alias@.

Ruby2CExtension emulates cref with the same semantics as Ruby. There are only
two problems.

First, when a method is defined in Ruby code it saves the current cref for
later use. From C it isn't possible to store an extra value when defining a
method, so Ruby2CExtension works around this problem by storing the cref in a
global variable. But there is still a problem when a @def@ is used/run
multiple times, because the cref can differ each time.

So if a @def@, that requires a cref, is used multiple times, then the compiled
C extension will raise an exception (this is the only case where code compiled
with Ruby2CExtension raises an exception that Ruby wouldn't raise). If a @def@
doesn't need a cref, then everything is fine and it can be used multiple
times. Examples:

PRE
["a", "b"].each { |s|
  class << s
    def bar; self; end # is OK, doesn't need cref
  end
}

["a", "b"].each { |s|
  class << s
    def baz; Array.new(self); end # fails the 2nd time
  end
}
PREEND

The second case fails because the constant lookup for Array needs a cref. If
you really need this to work, then you can use ::Array instead of Array,
because that won't need a cref.

Again in the usual case everything should be fine and if you really need to
use a @def@, that requires a cref, multiple times, then you might be able to
modify it so that it won't need a cref.

The second problem that arises from Ruby2CExtension emulating crefs is that
methods, that access Ruby's internal cref, will see the wrong cref and thus
not behave as expected. Those methods are @Module.nesting@, @Module.constants@
(but @Module#constants@ works), @autoload@ and @autoload?@ (use
@Module#autoload@ and @Module#autoload?@ instead).


h2. Block Pass

There currently is no way to pass a Proc instance as the block parameter to a
method call on the C side, i.e. there is no way to do the following from C:

PRE
def foo(proc)
  bar(&proc)
end
PREEND

Ruby2CExtension works around this by compiling the above to something similar
to this:

PRE
def foo(proc)
  tmp_proc = proc.to_proc
  bar { |*arg| tmp_proc.call(*arg) }
end
PREEND

The downside of this workaround is that it doesn't work (as expected) with
methods like @instance_eval@ and it is problematic if a proc is passed deep
into a recursive method, because that block will then be wrapped multiple
times.

This issue might be fixed if a future Ruby version provides a way to cleanly
pass a proc to a method call.


h2. Block Argument Semantics

Block argument semantics are a bit tricky, but Ruby2CExtension should get it
right for most cases, here are two cases where the result is wrong:

PRE
def t1(*a); yield *a; end
p t1([1, 2]) { |a| a }

def bl_pa_tst(); p yield([1, 2]); end
pc = proc { |*a| a }
bl_pa_tst(&pc)
bl_pa_tst { |*a| a }
PREEND

Ruby outputs:

PRE
[1, 2]
[[1, 2]]
[[1, 2]]
PREEND

The compiled C extension outputs:

PRE
[[1, 2]]
[1, 2]
[1, 2]
PREEND

But again, for most cases it should just work and maybe it will get better in
future Ruby2CExtension versions.


h2. Not Supported Features

Ruby files that use one or more of the above described problematic things will
usually compile just fine and fail or behave wrong at runtime. In contrast,
the following things will be catched at compile time. Most of them are just
not supported yet and might be added later.


h3. Control Flow

Most of the things that are not supported are related to control flow. Ruby
implements most of its control flow using @setjmp()@ and @longjmp()@. Most of
this is in @eval.c@ and there is no real API to access it, so Ruby2CExtension
has to do some tricks to make control flow work. For most cases workarounds
are implemented, but some of the harder cases are not (yet) supported.

The first thing that isn't supported is @return@ from inside a block. Also
@break@ with a value from inside a block is not supported (but @break@ without
a value is):

PRE
def foo
  bar(1, 2, 3) {
    next      # works
    next 42   # works
    redo      # works
    break     # works
    break 42  # does not work
    return    # does not work
    return 42 # does not work
  }
  return    # works
  return 42 # works
end
PREEND

For @while@/@until@ loops everything works.

Another problematic area is control flow "through" a @rescue@ or @ensure@
clause:

PRE
def foo
  while bar?
    begin
      next      # does not work
      next 42   # does not work
      redo      # does not work
      break     # does not work
      break 42  # does not work
      return    # does not work
      return 42 # does not work
      # but:
      while baz?
        next      # works
        next 42   # works
        redo      # works
        break     # works
        break 42  # works
        return    # does not work
        return 42 # does not work
      end
    rescue
      nil
    end
  end
end
PREEND


h3. @defined?@

The @defined?@ statement is also not fully supported, it works for most of the
common cases like constants, global variables, instance variables, class
variables and @$~@ (and derived). Ruby2CExtension fails at compile time if a
case is not supported.
